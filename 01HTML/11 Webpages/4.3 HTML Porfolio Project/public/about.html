<h1>About Me</h1>
<h4>
<p>In 2024 I will be post graduate with Integrated M.tech degree in Computer Science & Engineering with Specialisation in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning from the Vellore Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>As a Computer Science Engineering student, I have excellent problem-solving skills and ability to perform well in a team. Passionate about coding and enjoy learning something new everyday.</p>
  
<p>Modules studied till now include object-oriented programming, data structure & algorithms, database management system, operating systems, computer networks, artificial intelligence, artificial neural network, cloud computing, data mining & warehousing and machine learning with big data.</p>
  
<p>My natural curiosity for computers is what drove me towards my computer science degree. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by computers and the technical mechanics behind the monitor.</p>
  
<p>About to secure a first-class degree, I am now eager to secure roles that demand use of the skills gained during my studies. I love to connect with new people and build new relationships, so feel free to send me a message.</p>
